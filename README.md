Machine learning with theano

This project is about a simple experiencie with theano and machine learning. I am using MNIST dataset to generate 35 columns of train (ex.: DNN1.pkl) and then with those params generated by DNN1.pkl I did tests on test_set. 

I will show how train the dataset:

Parameters schema:
 param 0 the program name
 param 1 define a different call for train or not
 	if 0 execute 35 columns of train
 	if 1 different way
 param 2 define the numbers of train per column 
 param 3: define the normalization widths, max = 3:9

Examples:

The simple way to train all columns is use:
> python mcdnn.py 0
the output will be 35 models generated, probably after days, on /models folder

But, you have a different way to train the mcdnn:
> python mcdnn.py 1 5 0 10 12 14 16 18 20
On example above we use arguments like:
param 0 = mcdnn.py the programa name
param 1 = 1 to define a different call of train method
param 2 = 5 to define the numbers of train per column 
param 3:9 = [0 10 12 14 16 18 20] - the normalization widths
